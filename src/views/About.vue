      Naghmeh Shafiei is an Iranian-Canadian singer/songwriter and the front
      woman of the Montreal based post-modern rock band Naghmeh and the Southern
      Shores. She began performing as a solo artist in 2016 while living in San
      Francisco, deciding to abandon the corporate grind to pursue her dream of
      becoming a touring musician. Naghmeh jumped head first into the world of
      rock n’ roll and set off on the road over the following year with
      performances across Europe and South America. Her DIY musical empire was
      steadily growing as her music spread across the globe.

      After years on the road and a few international collaborations, Naghmeh
      moved back to her hometown of Montreal to focus on the next step of her
      career. She assembled a band, performed in every corner of the city, and
      recorded, co-produced and released her self-titled debut album in 2019.
      Her sound is authentic in its delivery and blends different eras of music
      into a punky, alternative, pop rock. With throaty melodies, satirical
      lyrics and a touch of triumphant rock n' roll, Naghmeh's goal is to
      transform the listener’s internal turmoil into a healing, whimsical dance.

      She holds a Master of Arts in Psychology and has worked as a front woman,
      song writer, event producer, performer, and session musician. She’s a
      fierce entrepreneur and has worked hard her entire life to rise above the
      prejudices she’s faced. Her story is inspiring and has just begun. Naghmeh
      is on a mission to bring love and justice to the world and is doing so
      through the art of music. She’s dedicating her efforts to produce her next
      musical offering which is set to release in 2021. Stay tuned for Queen Of
      Hearts!
